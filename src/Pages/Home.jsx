                        DEI is the acronym for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. IIDEA is a similar (but shuffled) acronym that incorporates Indigeneity and Accessibility. At the City of Peterborough, DEI, Accessibility, and Indigenous Relations are areas of work that are each given the respect and attention needed through their respective City Advisors. Together, the three Advisors work as the IIDEA Team to support City staff in applying a wider inclusion lens to their work. </p>
                        <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 w-full text-center mb-4">
Diversity is the presence of difference within a given setting. Differences can arise in our appearances, thoughts, likes and dislikes, values, and identities. Diversity may also relate to social categories such as relate to gender, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, education, marital status, sexual orientation, ability, and socioeconomic status, to name a few.
While equality means sameness, equity means fairness ‚Äì fair treatment, fair access, fair opportunity and fair advancement for all people. Equity is an approach that ensures everyone is supported in their personal and professional development. Unlike equality, equity does not aim to treat all individuals in the exact same way. Instead, equity recognizes that advantages and barriers exist, and that as a result, different people have different needs. Equity is therefore about ensuring that people have equal access to resources and benefits despite their individual circumstances.</p>
<p className="text-xl text-gray-600 w-full text-center mb-4">
Inclusion is the act of creating environments where people feel like they can bring their authentic selves. It means everyone feels valued, respected, and appreciated for their unique identities, even when they‚Äôre different from others. Inclusion outcomes are met when you, your institution, your policies and programs are truly inviting to all. And extends to the degree in which diverse individuals are able to participate in decision-making processes and development opportunities.
It is important to remember that Inclusion is not a natural consequence of diversity and that equity issues can often be invisible until we intentionally do the work to address them.
